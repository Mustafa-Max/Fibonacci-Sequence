# Fibonacci Sequence Generator in C#

This is a simple C# program that generates and prints a Fibonacci sequence using a List. The initial sequence is hardcoded, and the program extends it by adding the next 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mustafa-Max/Fibonacci-Sequence.git
cd Fibonacci-Sequence
```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Run the Program

```bash
dotnet run
```

This will compile and execute the C# program, generating and printing the extended Fibonacci sequence.
